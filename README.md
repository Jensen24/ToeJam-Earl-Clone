# ToeJam&Earl Clone
### This repository houses my ToeJam&Earl Clone that will serves as my final project for Video Game Development 1.
### Due to the scale of this project, a lot of research is put into learning the process of writing code so each source will be sited below.

### https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/posts/building-a-quadtree.html // Quadtree
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZRfEAuW7Q  Used mostly to learn how to implement IFrames  
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3n9JZVeTTo  Same reason as the video above
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZgEXWleWxg  Was going to originally have random pathing, but this guys implementation was too cool to not try and recreate
### https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66516450/enemy-pathfinding-through-waypoints-with-unity this comment helped with code behind traversing the waypoints
### Also shoutout monogames auto fill in, almost did all of FollowZPath() for me lol
